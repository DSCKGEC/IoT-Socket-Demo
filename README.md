## **Description**
This is a demo IoT project based on socket-io and express under DSC KGEC
### **What is Socket IO?**

[Socket.io](https://socket.io) is a Javascript networking library that runs server-side on Node.js and in the browser. It abstracts away websockets and other communication schemes, depending upon browser capabilities. It also includes convenient features such as broadcasts and multicasts, which are beyond the features of plain websockets.

It is a way to communicate between a client and a server which allows real-time data flow with bi-directional communication, i.e., we can flow data in both directions:
- Client to Server
- Server to Client

### **Why Socket.IO?**

It is a tool to implement realtime communication between server and clients very conveniently. Whenever an event occurs, the server can instantly send a message to the client(s).

### **How this Project will Help Us?**

This is a demo IoT project based on socket-io and express under DSC KGEC which will help node.js developers to start making APIs and implementing sockets as well as provide an insight to the working of a basic IoT system.
